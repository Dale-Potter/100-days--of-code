#README

Today's script will be the start of a much larger script. The aim is too produce an interface that allows the user to view and manipulate a graph.

Possible tools will be filtering results,overlay results and zooming.

Modules I expect to use are pandas, matplotlib and tkinter.

Project steps:

1 - View a graph on tkinter
2 - Input data or read CSV?
3 - Modify graph using through tkinter; eg, lines of best fit, colours, filter results, add titles ect..
4 - Add filter to results to smooth data, overlay with inital data
5 - (Maybe) Export graphs

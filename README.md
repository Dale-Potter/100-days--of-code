I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

This repo will document the entire 100 days of scripting.

Only time scripting for daily projects will be included, no time completing online courses or other projects will count towards the 100 days of coding.

The aim of the 100 days is to become a better and more effiecent python developer.

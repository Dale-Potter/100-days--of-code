#HourlyCheckup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this app is to keep track of my concentration levels through out the day. It will also keep track of what I am working on at that time, along with any questions or ideas I have which I want to research later on. This will hopefully assist with my productivity and keep me on track.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is aimed to combine both tkinter and datetime modules.

A pop up box will appear hourly to check I am still on target for the day. A slider bar will allow me to rate my concentration out of 5, a text box to write any notes and a submit button to store data.
